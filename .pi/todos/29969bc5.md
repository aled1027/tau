- **`skills.test.ts`** (17 tests): parseSkillMarkdown, serializeSkillMarkdown, SkillRegistry (register, unregister, duplicates, validation, systemPromptFragment, createReadSkillTool)
- **`prompt-templates.test.ts`** (16 tests): PromptTemplateRegistry (register, search, expand with $@, $ARGUMENTS, $1/$2, ${@:N}, ${@:N:L}, quoted args)
- **`extensions.test.ts`** (9 tests): ExtensionRegistry (tool registration/ownership, event emit/unsubscribe, user input handler, extension loading)

Setup: installed vitest, added `test` and `test:watch` scripts to package.json.
