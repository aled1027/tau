import { Agent } from "tau";

const openrouterApiKey = "sk-or-...."
const agent = await Agent.create({ apiKey: openrouterApiKey });

const res1 = await agent.prompt("Write hello world in Python");
console.log(res1.text);

const res2 = await agent.prompt("What time is it?");
console.log(res2.text);
```

See [docs/tau-core.md](docs/tau-core.md) for the full API reference.

npm run build  # builds the core library to dist/
```

## Development

Run the library build in watch mode alongside an example:

```bash
npm run build:watch          # rebuild library on changes

# If you want to test with an app, then do:
cd your/app/path/
npm run dev
```

## Examples
